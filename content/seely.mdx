In the usual categorical semantics of typed lambda-calculus, ie cartesian closed categories, we often treat $\beta$-conversion and $\eta$-conversion as equalities. The major issue with this approach is that we lose the computational process, as the intermediate stage of computation with its results.

Let's consider a simple example: 
$$ (\lambda x.a ) b \to a [x := b] $$
this is a step of computation that we would like to keep track of.
But in plain category model, that step becomes an equation, so "before" and "after" are identified, they are the same morphism !

The point of Seely is to keep the "rewrite step" itself as a first class citizen of the model.

That's exacttly why  he is using 2-categories.
A 2-category is a category enriched over categories.
* Objects: types
* 1-morphisms: terms-in-context (programs)
* 2-morphisms: reductions/conversions (computation steps, or chain of steps)
