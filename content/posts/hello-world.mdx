Welcome to my personal site. It’s built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, and **MDX** — statically exported so it runs great on GitHub Pages.

## What you’ll find

I use this space to document things I learn, ship project write-ups, and collect references that help me understand the world a little better.

### Projects

Deep dives on my builds, with architecture diagrams, lessons learned, and plenty of code.

### Notes

Lightweight posts for experiments, quick wins, and anything I don’t want to forget.

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

Write in MDX with components, code blocks, and clean typography.
