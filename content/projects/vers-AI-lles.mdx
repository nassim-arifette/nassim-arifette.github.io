*“Where should I start? Will it rain? Can I still see the fountains?”*  
During the Datacraft × Château de Versailles hackathon, we kept hearing these questions from visitors and staff alike. **Versailles Concierge** is the assistant we built to answer them—politely, quickly, and in their own language—then turn those answers into a **live, navigable plan**.  
➡️ **Live demo:** [vers-ai-lles.vercel.app](https://vers-ai-lles.vercel.app/)

## Why we built it

Versailles is magical *and* massive: timed tickets, long queues, 800 ha to cross, shifting weather, and crowd spikes that can derail even a careful itinerary. Our goal felt obvious once we walked the grounds:

- **Welcome anyone, in their language**, with fast, grounded answers.  
- **Transform a chat into a plan**—timeline, map, and route options.  
- **Adapt in real time** to weather, timing, and where the visitor actually is.

A small personal note: the “aha” moment came when a staff member asked us, in passing, *“If it rains after 3pm, would you reorder the day for a family with a stroller?”* That single constraint captured the whole product: **context-aware guidance** that respects the reality on site.

## What visitors see

Our main interface (`web/`) is a Vite + React SPA tuned for kiosks and phones:

- **Conversational chat** with pre-seeded prompts and bilingual copy in `constants/translations`.
- **Plan board** that turns the agent’s payload into a crisp timeline of highlights and notes.
- **Interactive map** (Leaflet) for curated routes, point-to-point directions, or a multi-stop demo.
- **“Meta” hints** (weather, likely crowding) via a `MetaSummary` that blends live APIs with time-of-day heuristics.
- **Local persistence** for session state, language, history, and last itinerary.

We first validated flows in a **Streamlit** prototype (`frontend/`), then ported the experience to React once the pieces felt right.

## The concierge under the hood

The backend (`backend/app.py`) is **FastAPI** orchestrating a **LangChain + LangGraph** agent:

- Chat runs on **`mistral-medium`** with structured tool calls and scoped memory.
- A **LangGraph state machine** (`backend/setup_graph.py`) routes between Q&A, plan creation, and tool execution.
- Memory is **per session**, so the assistant actually remembers visitor context.
- Clean endpoints: `/` (full agent), `/chat` (stateless), and `/tools/*` for weather, routing, GPS sharing, and plan recalculation.

### Knowledge & tools that stay grounded

- A **curated corpus** (`backend/data/tips_embedded.json`), embedded with `mistral-embed` and retrieved by cosine similarity.
- **Model Context Protocol** bridges (`mcp_servers/`) for OpenWeather / Open-Meteo and OpenStreetMap + OSRM routing.  
  The LLM asks; the bridges fetch; the agent composes a safe, auditable reply.
- `/tools/recalc_plan` can **rebuild an itinerary on the fly**—merging shared GPS, default waypoints, and constraints—then returns GeoJSON + human-readable steps.

## Shipping fast without chaos

- `docker-compose.yaml` spins up FastAPI, MCP servers, and optional Streamlit in one go.
- **Environment variables** (see `README.md`) centralize keys for Mistral, weather, and maps.
- We kept **clear boundaries**: Python backend, React web app, and MCP micro-services each with their own deps and hot-reload loops.

## The 48-hour sprint

1. **Walk the journey** with Versailles staff; collect the pivotal questions and choke points.  
2. **Prototype in Streamlit** to test tone and flow; harden the UX in React once it clicked.  
3. **Assemble the agent** with stateful tool-calling, RAG, and multilingual prompts that degrade gracefully when data is missing.  
4. **Wire weather & routing MCPs** so “Should I start with the gardens?” yields actionable, timed advice.  
5. **Demo end-to-end**: day plans, live routes, and contextual tips—in English or French—from a single chat window.

Honestly, the best part was the corridor testing: a guard asked us for a path that avoided stairs at closing time; a family wanted to front-load the gardens before a forecasted shower; a couple had only 90 minutes. Each mini-story nudged the product toward **practical, empathetic decisions**—and away from generic chat.
